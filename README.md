Predictive Analytics for Water Pump Functionality

Built a Gradient Boosting model in Python (scikit-learn, pandas) with 56% test accuracy to predict water pump functionality, using preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification metrics to identify key failure factors like water source type and pump age for improved resource planning.
